# DSA Project Documentation

This marks the beginning of my portfolio development during my Data Analysis course with The Incubator.

Throughout my Data Analysis training, I gained hands-on experience with tools such as Microsoft Excel, SQL (Structured Query Language), and Power BI. I also developed skills in data analysis, portfolio building, and version control using GitHub to showcase my work effectively.

## Project Topic: E-Commerce Product Insights | Strategic Analysis of Amazon Listings

### Project Overview

This data analysis project focuses on uncovering product and customer engagement insights from an Amazon-based e-commerce dataset. The goal was to explore key indicators that influence product performance, customer preferences, and strategic pricing.

By examining multiple data points—including product categories, pricing, discounts, customer reviews, and ratings—I was able to draw meaningful insights that support data-driven storytelling and decision-making. The analysis revealed trends in customer behavior, product visibility, and potential revenue, ultimately guiding recommendations for better marketing focus and product optimization.

This project also highlights the practical application of Microsoft Excel tools such as pivot tables, calculated columns, and dynamic dashboards in building a clear, interactive summary of insights.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used in this analysis is the Amazon Case Study Excel Worksheet, obtained from the Learning Management System (LMS) of the DSA Data Analysis Program, under the Capstone Project Files.

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com)
    - Used for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis through pivot tables, calculated columns, and formulas. Also employed to build an interactive dashboard for visualizing insights.
- GitHub
    - Utilized for version control and to host the project as part of a professional portfolio.
